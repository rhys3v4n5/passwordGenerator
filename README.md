# A few password related scripts

Just a simple project I decided to make to save me the time (debatable) of having to use third-party tools to check password strength or if Apple/Google password generation 
stops working for me.

Will probably work on making more " password generation in the future such as xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx.

Currently it's asking for the name and DoB, this is because I am assuming that in these password requirements I have made that the username/name and any important dates will already
be known at the point of creating the password. I've required that passwords must be at least 8 characters, contain special characters, contain capital letters, numbers, and 
lowercase letters and no sensitive information.

Going to work on eventually converting this into a web app using Django.

Thanks for checking this out :smile:
